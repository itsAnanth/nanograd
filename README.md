# About

This is an educational project that was done by following the tutorial on micrograd by one of the pillars of AI tech industry Andrej Karpathy [micrograd tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)

Most of the code in this Project will be same as that of the tutorial, as the sole purpose of this project is for me to learn reverse mode auto-diff and backprop generalization through computational graphs

There will be few differences here and there for me to look back and reflect upon
